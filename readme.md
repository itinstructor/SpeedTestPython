# Speed Test in Python

## Internet bandwidth tester in Python with CustomTkinter

This project leverages using ChatGPT 3.5 to build parts of an application.

I started with a functional Tkinter program I created using the speed-cli Python library. This program was the final step in a tutorial I wrote for my programming classes. [Python Speedtest Tutorial.pdf](./Python%20Speedtest%20Tutorial.pdf)
